      header: The Soapmaking Process
      paragraph: >
        The soapmaking process is very low impact on the environment, meaning that we don't use
        motorized or carbon-intensive equipment. The only non-manual power required is a small
        electric burner to melt the oils on low heat for about 15 minutes per batch. Every other
        step in the process is done by hand.
      process_header: 'In my "soap cellar" here is the process I use:'
      list_item1: Measure all ingredients precisely using a digital scale.
      list_item2: Dissolve lye in water. The chemical reaction creates a lot of heat.
      list_item3: Melt the oils over low heat.
      list_item4: When oils have reached 80 degrees, I add the grapefruit seed extract.
      list_item5: Get both water and oil to be exactly 80 degrees.
      list_item6: When at 80 degrees, add the water to the oil.
      list_item7: 'Stir until the mixture "traces" or leaves a faint impression on the surface.'
      list_item8: Add any nutrients and essential oils.
      list_item9: Pour the mixture into a wooden rectangular mold, or into separate molds.
      list_item10: Cover the mold with blankets for 24 hours to complete the saponification.
      list_item11: >
        If using a rectangular mold, cut into long bars after about a week, then into short bars
        after another week, then cure for another three weeks.
      list_item12: >
        After about a total of six weeks, unmold and trim each bar by hand to remove the white
        coating.
      list_item13: Print labels and wrap each bar.

      paragraph1: >
        We provide natural, environmentally sustainable, rejuvenating soap products. Like so many
        products in our everyday lives, the modern equivalent of our ancestors' soap is not an
        improvement.
      paragraph2: >
        Many commercial soaps contain harmful synthetic chemicals and tallow (an animal product).
        By using natural and inherently safe ingredients, we protect our bodies and our environment.
      paragraph3: >
        These soaps promote a healthy environment. We don't use harmful synthetic chemicals; only
        high quality natural (mostly organic) ingredients. No animal products are used,* and there
        is no animal testing.
      paragraph4: >
        Environmental impacts include the transportation of supplies (usually by mail), the
        transportation of the soap (also usually by mail), and the hot water used for cleaning the
        soapmaking equipment.
      paragraph4_footnote: '*Oatmeal Honey soap contains honey.'
      paragraph5: >
        The base for all of my soaps is the same luxurious mixture.  To this base I add a variety
        of natural nutrients (such as Vitamin E) and pure essential oils for scent:
      list_item1: Olive Oil
      list_item2: Palm Oil
      list_item3: Coconut Oil
      list_item4: Distilled Water
      list_item5: Sodium Hydroxide (Lye)
      list_item6: Grapefruit Seed Extract
      list_item6_footnote: (as a natural preservative)
